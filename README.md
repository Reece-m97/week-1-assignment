# week-1-assignment


I met all of the requiured user goals, ensuring the site can be adaptable for all screen sizes.
I also met the first four stretch goals. 
Instead of the last goal I wanted to implement snap scrolling instead. This is something I wasn't able to do, I added it to the css however, it conflicted with scroll-behaviour.
